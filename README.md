# UdemyVueT8
Task 8 of VueJs Udemy Course - This is the very simple VueJs Code of the Task 8 of the nice Udemy Course of VueJs 2.0 .
Basically, 3 exclusive buttons select one of three frames, using the VueJs reserved word "component" for using just
one "space" in the html page for the component, created dynamically by the selected button.
For obvious reason, the folder "node-modules" was not uploaded to the repository. To create the folder in your
machine, just run "npm install". You must have npm installed in your machine, of course. NPM is installed with Node.js
The Blue,Green and Red Green Vue components must be put inside a folder named /src/components, how showed in the App.vue.
(This is a very basic example of the "dynamic component" feature of VueJs 2.0, but, for any doubt, follow my e-mail:
